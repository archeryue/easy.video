## Background
It's 9 o'clock AM, 14 Sep 2025, I'm sitting before a window of Shangri-la, thinking about what should I do in this exciting and ever-changing new era? I've been learning AI algorithms for a while. But as I delve deeper into my studies, I can't help but wonder—what should I do after finishing my learning? Should I pursue algorithm research? No, probably not. It seems I might still be better off creating an AI product.  
Perhaps I should start trying to create small things now. After all, the beginning of building a great product is simply to start making one. Recently, video creation agents have been quite popular, and I’ve tried out many of them. To be honest, these products seem relatively simple—at least from the perspective of an ignorant beginner like me. So why not challenge myself to create a demo of a video creation agent product in just one day (8 hours)? At the very least, I should give it a shot.  
Let the hack begin!!!
## Coding Records
 - 9:00 I've done some deep research yesterday, and have a rough idea in my mind. I decide to use google cloud and google gemini to build the demo. Google has everything I need, makes the demo simple enough. As for coding tools, since I'm back in China, using Claude Code has become quite troublesome. I'll just use Cursor for now.
 - 9:15 I've set up the web framework with cursor, and have it run a self-test. The UI issues are pretty obvious, but at least it's running. Time to go downstairs for a bowl of noodles—I'm starving.
 - 10:30 I've spent a lot of time adjusting the UI, and it's just a waste of time. I should test the gemini api instead. Now I need to head out -- I have a lunch appointment with an old friend.
 - 15:20 Back to work! Let's test the gemini API first.
 - 17:55 Finally Finished the gemini API test. Waste a ton of time to test the video api. Add an intention check module before generation. For now, I just download the generated videos into the public/videos dir. I should upload the videos to the OSS I think. But that’s not urgent—I might first make the canvas support multiple images and videos, and then support the prompt for generating videos from multiple images. Acctually I feel hungry now, time to eat.
 - 6:39 Still have not got my meal. Watched a boxing match, Alvarez vs Crawford, which may be the best game of the year. Okay, let's try to coding for a while.
